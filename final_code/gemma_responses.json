The most common symptoms of Chiari malformation are headache, neck pain, and problems with balance and coordination. The symptoms of Chiari malformation are caused by pressure on the brain and spinal cord. The pressure can cause a variety of problems including difficulty swallowing, problems with speech, and a change in the level of consciousness.

The most common cause of bleeding from the gums is due to gum infection (gingivitis or periodontitis). The bleeding from the nose is due to the fact that the small blood vessels in the nose are very close to the surface and are easily damaged by the hard brushing of the toothbrush. I would suggest that you see a periodontist and get a complete mouth scaling and root planing done. This will help in controlling the infection and reduce the bleeding. You can also use a desensitizing toothpaste like Sensodyne to reduce the bleeding from the teeth. I hope this information was useful to you. Be", "Hi... Thank you for consulting in Khpaltabib. It seems your kid is having what is called as with Khpaltabib.  This is a very common problem in this age group and is due to the nature of the food we give to the kids. The food which we give like cereals, pulses, vegetables and fruits are all high in fiber content. The kids below the age of 2 years cannot digest and assimilate the high fiber diet and hence this problem. I suggest you follow like this -1. Give her lots of fluids - around 10-12 cups per day.2. Add some amount of ghee to the food to increase the fat content of the diet.3. Do not use any constipating agents like Docusate as it can cause electrolyte imbalance in the body.4. Do not use any laxatives as it can cause what is called as \"use and abuse\" - meaning the kids will have constipation when the medicine is not given.5. The best way to relieve constipation is by - a. increasing the fluid intake b. increasing the fat content of the diet c. giving high calorie, high protein diet d. giving adequate amount of exercise to the kids.
