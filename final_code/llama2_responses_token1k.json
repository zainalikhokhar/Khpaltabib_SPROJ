It is a condition in which a solid piece of material (stone) forms in the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Stones in the kidney or ureter (renal or ureteral stones) are the most common type of stones. Stones in the bladder (cyststones) are the most common type of stones. Stones in the urethra (urethral stones) are the least common type of stones. The most common symptom of kidney stones is pain, usually in the lower back, abdomen, groin or genitals. The pain of a kidney stone is often severe and is called renal colic. Other symptoms of kidney stones include frequent urination, blood in the urine, nausea and vomiting, painful urination and frequent urination at night. If a stone is blocking the flow of urine from the kidney, a person may experience pain and pressure in the abdomen. The treatment depends on the size of the stone, where it is located and whether it is causing problems. A small stone may pass on its own without treatment. A large stone may need to be removed with surgery or treated with medications or shock waves. If a stone is blocking the flow of urine from the kidney, a person may need to have a procedure called a stent placed in the ureter to keep the ureter open. A stent is a small tube that is inserted into the ureter through a catheter. The stent will stay in place until the stone is small enough to pass. I hope this answers your question.
