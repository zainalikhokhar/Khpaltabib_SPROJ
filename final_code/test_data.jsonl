She is having NAN PRO 1 in addition to mother feed. For the last couple of days, she is getting GREEN WATERY motion and she is not getting sleep during the night from her 2nd month. Is it something because of the Formula milk we are using for her ? Please clarify. Also please let us know the alternate for Mother Feed, as it is not adequate for her. Thanks, Veda", "output": "Thank you for asking on Khpaltabib. Breastfeeding is the best food for a baby and there can be no substitute for it. Formula milk is hard to digest and hence affects the quality of stool. Greenish stools are caused due to rapid transit through the large intestine. It is not a cause for worry. If mothers milk is inadequate and if formula feeds are not well tolerated, you may introduce small amounts of mashed boiled semi-solid food make from rice, pulses and vegetables. Although weaning is suggested from 6 months of age, earlier weaning is also acceptable if mothers milk is inadequate. Hope that helps.

Swelling in the legs and feet can come from many causes, one of them being general circulation or ineffectiveness of the kidneys to rid the body of excess water. Most times, people with lower extremity swelling will be placed on diuretics (\"water pills\") to see if that helps reduce the swelling.

Between two mont I check my blood two time it show the same lymphocytes high then normal. My Docter said you don t have any complain. So it s okay. But this happen after I my saw my docter, now I m worried.", "output": "Hello, I will add Khpaltabib.  One of the causes could be a condition called bronchitis which is a type of inflammation of the lining of our large breathing tube or bronchus. This condition is usually viral and may show slightly higher lymphocytes on your blood count. Blood in the sputum or spit may also arise from the inflammation of the lining of the nose. These conditions are not serious and resolves. However, one should also know that blood in the sputum can arise from tuberculosis or cancer type diseases also which from your description does not appear to be the cause. However, my advice is that you should get a test called peripheral blood smear done. You must also obtain your test report on absolute lymphocyte count. Persistently raised lymphocyte count has to be investigated with additional tests such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy. At the moment bone marrow biopsy is not necessary, but you must get a peripheral blood smear examination done by a pathologist along with an absolute lymphocyte count done. You may also feel for any lumps in your neck and armpit. If there are any you must get investigated by a physician promptly. I presume that your platelet count is OK because low platelets can cause bleeding. Overall my opinion is that your blood in the sputum may be a temporary phenomenon as you recover from a viral or allergy related illness, but it is important to also get some investigations done. Therefore, please get the following investigations:Peripheral blood smear with absolute lymphocyte countSputum examination with cytologyChest XRayPlease feel free to clarify your test results also Best regards"}, {"instruction": "As a medical LLM working as an assistant for a real doctor, your task is to provide specific and accurate diagnoses for the patients' queries.

(FYI he is only 49 years old....) It has been a roller-coaster of emotions for both of us, which social workers discussing \"quality vs quantity\" of life, arranging for a hospital bed to be delivered to our house, etc. Two days after being released from the hospital (where they had moved him to the palliative care unit - not a good sign.....) he was given a schedule for chemo and radiation treatments. We attended a chemo class yesterday and found out his schedule calls for doctor visits 2 and 3 times a week, as well as a five-week period where he will go everyday (M-F) for radiation treatments. Now we are both confused. When we heard the six month diagnosis we were planning on how this time would be spent (trips to the beach, fishing, etc) but now with the treatments scheduled, we are thinking that perhaps the six month diagnosis has changed - is there still hope for survival??? is what we keep playing out in our heads, thinking surely the doctors would not prescribe these intensive treatments if he was surely going to die by January???

Because, chemo and radio is necessary to achieve even those 6 months. I understand your concerns, but pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous and has very poor prognosis. Radioth and chemo is the last option for palliative treatment, and it can only slightly prolong lifetime. So many patients even decide not to treat it if they consider that 3 or 4 more months are not worth of fighting. This is up to you.

Thanks", "output": "Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. We call this Phenomenon as Triple response of Lewis. This is due to scratch on the skin. You had scratched the skin due to itching. In allergy, there is an increased release of a chemical called Histamine by Mast cells in our body. This histamine can cause itching, and thus you had scratched the skin. This scratching lead to erythema (redness) due to blood vessel dilation locally and increased permeability in blood vessels. These may look like red and pink dots. This is normal, and it can disappear in 30 to 40 minutes, once the histamine is broken down into inactive chemicals.However, in more than half of the peoples with high dose of allergens, this may persist and lead to late phase reaction up to 24 hours to 48 hours and then disappears.Thus, nothing to worry about, you can wait up to 48 hours. Please take antihistamines like cetirizine and mast cell stabilizers like montelukast. This will help in further release of anti-histamines from mast cells. Hope this helps.

What are her options until she can get in to see a new doctor?", "output": "Hi rick5547Thanks for coming to ChatDoctorCOPD needs staging via spirometry and accordingly treatment has to be given. The treatment also depends on whether the patient has got respiratory failure, is she in acute exacerbation, has she got any comorbidities like heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, depression etc... You can try a combination of long acting beta 2 agonists like albuterol or formoterol plus inhaled corticosteroid like budesonide or fluticasone along with long acting muscarinic antagonists like geotropism... If your wife is in acute exacerbation manifested by increased baseline dyspnea, cough, sputum production and its purulence...you can give her a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin clavulanic acid and azithromycin along with short course of steroids like prednisolone 40 mg once a day for 10-14 days....and don't forget the nebulization by albuterol and ipratropium 6 holy... If she is continuously in respiratory failure then probably she is needing controlled oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation just above 90%.... best wishes"}, {"instruction": "As a medical LLM working as an assistant for a real doctor, your task is to provide specific and accurate diagnoses for the patients' queries.

My father was shoveling snow and felt chest pain. He went to the doctor and they said it was just a chest pull. When he tried to shovel the following day, my mother told him not too because he could hurt his chest muscle and have heart damage. Is that true or is she just being a worry wart.", "output": "Hello Welcome to Khpaltabib. Shoveling or any physical exercises can cause chest muscle pull but not damage to the heart muscles. The heart muscles are smooth muscle fibers which do not directly take part in any voluntary body activity. Moreover, the heart is located safely inside the rib cage and damage to heart muscle while shoveling is not possible. However since shoveling is a physical exercise (like running or swimming), it increases the workload on the heart. The heart requires more blood supply during physical exertion and people with blockages in the heart can sustain chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart. So indirectly it can lead to chest pain if he has blockages in the heart. Do if he gets pain every time he shovels or runs or jogs, then he must get evaluated from the cardiac point of view. Also since he has just sustained a chest wall muscle pull, its advice to rest and what your mother is asking is just out of concern. Wishing all of you good health.

I suppose more than one artery is involved (or the left main artery is involved) that's why your doctor has asked to go for a bypass. There are other non-invasive methods like CT angiography to detect blockages in the heart. But of all that an angiography is the most important and gives the maximum information. No doctor will operate on a patient without doing an angiography at first. Further, a bypass surgery also has good results these days. It will take about 7- 10 days stay in the hospital and after that a month for recovery at home. But the long term effects of bypass are very good, and he may not require another procedure for next 10-15 years. He has got significant blockages in the heart. So please don't go searching after other options and go ahead with the bypass surgery. Thanks for posting here.

I Just go and brush it off in the morning and it doesnt happen again throughout the day so only happens when im sleeping??", "output": "Hello Asia, Bleeding gums can be a sign that you are at risk for, or already have, gum disease. However, persistent gum bleeding may be due to serious medical conditions such as leukemia and bleeding and platelet disorders. Bleeding gums are mainly due to inadequate plaque removal from the teeth at the gum line. This will lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. If plaque is not removed through regular brushing and dental appointments, it will harden into what is known as tartar. Ultimately, this will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jawbone disease known as periodontitis. Other causes are Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, scurvy, leukemia, vitamin K deficiency. What to do now, practice night hygiene before sleeping and avoid eating too late in the night. Brush twice daily. Consult a dentist and/or a hematologist.

They take time to be effective, and they need to be performed regularly for long time. Once your asthma is under good control, your Khpaltabib. 3. I would also suggest you to get allergy testing done which will help you to know the substances you are allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.4.

I came from Pakistan on a visit visa to Saudi Arabia 6 weeks back.   A week before my departure one of my tooth broken during taking meal.  The dentist was consulted who told me about some infection.  He did filling on 3 teeth and asked to take Augmentin 625 mg (twice a day) for 5 days and also advised for having extra Calcium tabs.  A month back, I started feeling pain in teeth where filling was done.  I consulted the same dentist and took Amoxycillin 625 mg tabs for 6 days and the pain stopped. However, I am having blood in salvia mainly in the early morning. I also find blood signs in nostrils when I sneeze in the morning. I am taking other medicines for Blood Pressure including blood thinning tablets (Ascard-75 mg) and Citanew (10 mg) for heart rythem. What may be the cause of blood in salvia and what is your advice..?", "output": "Hi. Welcome to Khpaltabib . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case if you have pain in any of the tooth that is filled, and you are taking antibiotics for it, but the pain will not be relieved as it seems that the nerves have been exposed during making a cavity in the tooth to remove decay and retain the filling material and the nerve irritation and inflammation is the cause of pain. For this consult your dentist again and get an x-ray done and in case if the nerves are exposed removal of the filling followed by Root canal treatment can resolve the problem. The blood in saliva can be due to infection in the gums causing inflammation of the gums and bleeding which is evident through saliva. While in case if there is blood spots through nostrils it is possible that due to hard sneezing there is some rupture of minor blood vessels leading to blood spots. The other thing that is possible is that your blood pressure is rising leading to bleeding, or it can also be a side effect of certain medicine that you are taking. You should consult a dentist and get evaluated and also get the blood pressure checked. In case if the blood pressure is high consult your treating physician so that he can alter the doses of the medicine as per the requirement. In case if allergic reaction is found change of the antibiotics can help. Hope this information helps.
